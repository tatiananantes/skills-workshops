# Project: Encapsulation & Cohesion Practical

To achieve these goals:
  >"I can build with objects"
  >"I can test-drive my code"

## Action Plan
- [Exercises and supporting material here](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/main/practicals/object_oriented_design/encapsulation.md)

## Evidence Plan
  - How comfortable do you feel assessing how cohesive a class is?
  - Did you successfully break the `SecretDiary` class up into multiple cohesive classes?
