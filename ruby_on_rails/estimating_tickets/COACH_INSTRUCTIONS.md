# Estimating tickets

## Starter (15 minutes)

* Do "thumbs" on the [learning objectives](README.md#learning-objectives).

* Work with the students to estimate existing tickets on the board. You can use Trello labels to point the tickets.

## Main (30 minutes)

* Break the students up into groups, and give each group a small feature to analyse.
* Groups should break down the feature into small chunks and estimate how long they will take to complete.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

* Look at each of the tickets the students have made, and discuss the process. Encourage students to move any that they are unsure of into 'Needs research' column until they can be properly researched and understood.

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.
