# Debugging 1

A program to introduce you to debugging.

## Learning goals

By the end of the workshop, all developers can:
- Explain what a bug is
- Explain a good approach to debugging
- Follow an effective debugging process to identify a bug
- Follow an effective debugging process to fix a bug

### Instructions

In this program, there are three bugs. You have to find them, and fix them. You have to do this as systematically as possible:

- Tighten the loop (find the _exact line_ the bug is coming from)
- Get visibility (use `p` to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)
- Once you know the _one thing_ that is wrong, out of place, misspelled, or not giving you what you expect, try to fix it.

> Wisest are they who try only one thing to fix the problem. Faffing about trying whatever occurs to you next is a recipe for development hell.

### Setup

* Clone the skills workshop repository.

* `cd` into the `test_driven_development/debugging_1` directory.

* Run `bundle install`.

* Run the tests with `rspec`.
