# Control Flow

In this workshop, you'll learn the basics of control flow.

##### By the end of this session, all developers can...
- Explain what is meant by "control flow"
- Implement an if statement with an elsif condition
- Implement a while loop


## Exercises

### If statements – Implement FizzBuzz
- Get a number from the user
- If the number is divisible by 3, the program will puts "Fizz"
- If the number is divisible by 5, the program will puts "Buzz"
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (15), the program will puts "FizzBuzz"

### While loops – Create a parrot
- The user is prompted for input
- The computer repeats the input back to the user
- The program stops when the user enters the word "STOP"

### Combining both – Create a counter program that can be used to make sure your local supermarket is not overcrowded
- Every time someone enters the supermarket, the user will enter +, and the total increments
- Every time someone leaves the supermarket, the user will enter -, and the total decrements
- If the user enters 'exit' the program stops
