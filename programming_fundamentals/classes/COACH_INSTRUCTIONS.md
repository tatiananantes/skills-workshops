# Classes

## Prerequisite knowledge

You might need to demonstrate these things..
- Basics of scope (method variables vs instance variables. A brief mention of how we can expose instance variables for other classes to use. Plus, why we need to create an instance of a class to be able to call a method on it).

##### Depending on where the group is at, you may wish to do an intro that touches on...
- What a class is
- Why they are useful
- Defining a class

## Main (20 mins)
