# Using Methods


## Learning Objectives 

Ask the devs to show thumbs on their understanding of the following objectives. 

- Explain what a method is
- Explain why we use methods
- Able to define some methods
- Explain what SRP is and why we use it?

## Intro (20 mins)
##### Depending on where the group is at, you may wish to do an intro that touches on the following showing some live code examples...

- What a method is
- How to define a method and how we use them to group behaviour. For example, the following 2 code snippets do the same thing but a method is better for OOD, readability, understanding the code and reusability. 

```
p "hello"
``` 

and 

```
def say_hello
  p "hello"
end
```

- The limitations of methods that cannot take arguments
- How to pass arguments to methods and why we want to
- How methods interact with each other
- How to execute methods

## Main (20 mins)

Developers do the exercises listed in the readme

## Plenary (20 mins)

- Ask learners to share their solutions or ask them to guide you towards the solution.
- Refer back to the learning objectives and ask learners to indicate how they feel about each one, using their thumbs.
